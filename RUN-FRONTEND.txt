YOUR UI (Sunaina Yaseen portfolio) runs from THIS folder only.

TO SEE YOUR UI:
1. Open terminal.
2. cd to this folder (the one that contains src, portfolio-backend, portfolio-frontend):
   cd C:\Users\MMT\Desktop\portfolio\portfolio
3. Run: npm run dev
4. Open the URL Vite shows (e.g. http://localhost:5178) in the browser.

DO NOT run "npm run dev" from inside portfolio-frontend — that shows the default Vite template, not your portfolio.

This folder = your real portfolio (Contact, Skills, About, Projects).
portfolio-frontend folder = empty template only.
