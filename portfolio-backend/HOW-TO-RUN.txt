1. Open a terminal.
2. Go to this folder: cd portfolio-backend
3. Run: python app.py
4. You should see: "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"
5. Leave this terminal open. In another terminal, start the React app (npm run dev from the portfolio folder).
6. Test: open http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/hello in browser – you should see {"message": "Hello from Flask!"}
7. Submit the contact form on your portfolio – the message will be sent to the backend and you'll see "Form received!" on success.

If the form shows an error, make sure Flask is running and the URL is http://127.0.0.1:5000 (port 5000).
